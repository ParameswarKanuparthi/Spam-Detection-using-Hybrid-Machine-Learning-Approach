# Spam-Detection-using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Approach
Training the machine to detect the message is spam or not by 3 famous classification Machine Learning algorithms
(Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Bernoulli Naive Bayes and 
Logistic Regression).

All the 3 individual algorithms has been trained and gives their results.  
The final result is the mode of the results of the above 3 algorithms. 
Detecting the message spam using Hybrid approach (using 3 algos) gives much more accuracy than the individual algorithms.
