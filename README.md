# Spam-or-Ham-Classification-using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Approach
Training the machine to classify the message as spam or ham by 3 famous classification Machine Learning algorithms 
(Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression). 

All the 3 individual algorithms has been trained and gives their results.  
The final result is the mode of the results of the above 3 algorithms. 
Classification of message as Spam or Ham using Hybrid approach (using 3 algos) gives much more accuracy than the individual algorithms.
